## Topic Extraction

   The Basic Idea:

We use these Word2Vec vectors to form clusters by feeding the desired topics to be learnt as seeds to the model, we      follow a unique approach in performing the clustering, that ultimately leads to the formation of clusters that           capture the semantics of any topic fed into it.
    
    
    USPs of our model,
   * It is capable of predicting topics based on the context in which a word/phrase of the text occurs.
